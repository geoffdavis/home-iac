This repository contains OpenTofu configuration for systems supporting my home systems, including the Unifi UDM Pro router, Amazon AWS resources, and basic credentials management using 1Password.

Some of the resources in this repository are consumed by a sister repository located at <https://github.com/geoffdavis/talos-gitops>. I typically have it checked out at `../talos-gitops`.

There are a number of Taskfiles containing various tasks and helper scripts for setting up the right environment variables and secrets.
